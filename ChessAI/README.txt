This repository includes all C# source code used for my Chess AI, but it does not include the necessary frameworks to connect to the game server where it runs (since it was only up for spring semester 2013). This code should at least give an idea of what my AI is trying to accomplish, how it utilizes bit boards to generate moves/evaluate captures/etc. and the generic priniciples behind a sophisticated MiniMax search algorithm.

Big thanks to winglet and NagaSkaki for providing excellent information regarding bit boards and move generation - could not have done it without their help. Also, major thanks to the Chess Programming Wiki for useful insights on Static Exchange Evaluation and various pruning techniques used to improve my MiniMax search.
